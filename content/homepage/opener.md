Hi there. @Daen Should Probably write something here, we are a server operating on the following principles:


- No admin intervention: Players are free to build or grief as they please.
- No moderators: No players on the server have any moderator commands / tools / abilities.
- **Always on the latest version of Minecraft.**
- Vanilla Parity: We try to keep all mechanisms and farms that work on Vanilla working on the server
