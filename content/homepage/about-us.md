We originally started on the 1.14 anarchy server [Enchanted Sword](enchantedsword.net), a highly praised anarchy server that fell into ruin as item dupes had ruined the economy beyond repair. We founded Eternal Void in Sep 2021 to provide an unparalleled anarchy experience using all of our knowledge gained from running a critically acclaimed anarchy server for a year and a half.
